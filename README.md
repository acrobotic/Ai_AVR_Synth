Overview
---
This repository includes the Eagle design files (schematics and layout) for our [MIDI Synthesizer Kit][1].  The Kit is based 
on the ATMega328 Microcontroller, which we have programmed to read input data from a series of potentiometers and tactile buttons, 
and to produce synthesized sound through an onboard audio jack.

The firmware files along with code samples are also included in this repository.

This kit was designed by [Sam Stratter][] ([@humanHardDrive]).
